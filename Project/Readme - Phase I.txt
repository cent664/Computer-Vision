Summarizing what I have accomplished to date:

I have read the ECO paper and part of the CCO-T paper. (Having trouble understanding the math)
I have setup the environment, incorporated the external libraries and compilers needed, and implemented the code in MATLAB. I have tested the code on the crossing sequence (SV, DEF, FM, OPR, BC)* from the OTB 2015 dataset and it works, tracking the object.

Information on the data set I will be working on:

I'll be using the Object Tracking Benchmark 2015 dataset.
The dataset consists of 100 different sequences of images. The sequences are marked according to the kind of challenge they provide to the tracker.

The dataset aims to challenge the following 9 criteria in visual tracking:

Illumination Variation (IV)
Scale Variation (SV)*
Occlusion (OCC)
Deformation (DEF)*
Motion Blur (MV)
Fast Motion (FM)*
In-Plane Rotation (IPR)
Out-of-Plane Rotation (OPR)*
Out-of-View (OV)
Background Clutters (BC)*
Low Resolution (LR)
